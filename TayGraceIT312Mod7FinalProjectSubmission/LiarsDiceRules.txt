There must be at least two players to play Liar's Dice!
Each player gets a set of five dice, which is rolled one time when we start the game.
On your turn, you will be able to view only your set of dice.
On each of your turns, you will be asked two values : a guess of how many dice of a certain value are on the table.
The first guess you will be asked about is how many dice are on the table.After each turn, the value of this guess must increase by at least one dice.
You have been provided a six sided dice, so you can only guess a dice side value between 1 and 6.
You can call liar at any point if you think the last player’s guess is wrong.This will end the game.
You, the accuser, will win if the last player’s guess is wrong.
The last player will win if they guess the correct amount of dice and the right side that was rolled.
You can view everyone’s dice at the end of the game.
